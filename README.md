## Contribution Guide

After setting up and creating a cloud function code-snippet (derivative, action, extensions) on Rowy as per the above instructions, you can contribute them to the Rowy's open-source templates repo by submitting PR with the code snippet from the derivative you have create.

Every PR should be made to the relevant directory structure of derivative, action, extension. Ensure the submission is a folder with the relevant name of the code-snippet. The folder should contain two files:
- Code snippet: Template 
- Readme file: Add any details about the code snippet including any additional instructions as required.
